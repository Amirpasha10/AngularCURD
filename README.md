I am glad to have been a part of RB. In which, I got a chance to work with you and team, and learn many things. I appreciate the chance to work on this  project. Right now I’d like to work in another project which has a lot of scope with my skills set. 

As my interest lies in other development, I’d like to work in the such project where there is more scope for skills development. This would not only give me self-satisfaction but also help me to build a very strong career. It would be a better use of my skills.

I kindly request you to consider my request and do the needful at the earliest.

 Thank you very much.
